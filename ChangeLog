    - The ->initialize method was both broken and undocumented. RT
      #51260. (Dave Rolsky)

      discourage calling ->new directly. Doing so may be deprecated in a
      future release. (Dave Rolsky)

0.21 2009-09-12
    - Various modules in this class were trying to load the old pre-0.20
      classes, which have all been renamed. Tests passed if you had 0.19 or
      earlier installed, but failed for fresh installations. (Dave Rolsky)

0.20 2009-09-11
    - Converted this extension to use roles rather than metaclass
      subclasses. This means it will cooperate with other extensions on CPAN,
      like MooseX::StrictConstructor, etc. (Dave Rolsky)

      on up.

0.15 2009-04-07
    - Fixed to work with Moose 0.73_01

    - When an object was implicitly constructed by calling
      ClassName->attribute, it skipped the BUILD and BUILDARGS defined
      for a class. Report and test from Josh in RT #42690. (Dave
      Rolsky)

0.14 2009-01-22
